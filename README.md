Strength Is Beautiful
===================

Awesome strength training how tos for women!

About:

A weight training / sports how to video search tool for women, featuring women athletes, coaches, and trainers. Developed for espnW Hackathon 2012.

Core Features:

Select Level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
Select workout target (Upper Body, Core, Legs)

Selecting a combination of the above will display videos catered to desired workout and level, and will suggest other videos to view based on those that they have just watched (may be able to filter videos to exclude some content)

* Stuff that would be nice to have: *

Some way of user rating videos with an up/down vote
Allow users to submit videos to get feedback or provide how-tos
Some way of users motivating others / bragging when they have done a workout session (tweeting or fb post etc)

Technical Things:
Youtube API - display videos in HTML5 (was iframe recommended?), use API to search vids, up/down vote, and suggested videos
Maybe auth? If so, might be easy to implement OAuth
Shiny buttons to allow people to click on things
maybe database to hold auth data + youtube data
